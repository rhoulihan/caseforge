# Design Spec — CaseForge: Business-Case Archives

**Date:** 2026-06-07 · **Status:** Built (shipped across PRs #12–#15, on top of the PR #11 discount/regeneration prerequisite; part of the unreleased v0.4.0) · **Author:** Rick Houlihan + Claude<br>
**One-line:** Persist each business case as a portable, launcher-managed `.zip` so a rep can close the app, reopen a prior case, refine it (with full continuity), and add more source files — all locally, with the same fail-closed anonymization guarantees as a fresh run.

> Storage model decided: **launcher-managed archives** in `~/CaseForge/archives/*.zip` with a home screen that lists saved cases. The design body below stands; the **"As built"** section immediately following reconciles the handful of places where the shipped code settled differently from the sketch.

## As built (PRs #12–#15)

The feature shipped as designed; a few details settled differently in code and are reconciled here. The design body (§§1–13) is otherwise accurate.

- **Build sequencing landed as four PRs, not three.** The §12 plan was PR 0 (discount) + PR A/B/C. In practice **PR A was split in two**: PR #12 (the persistence *layer* — Go endpoints, the TS (de)serialize round-trip, the launcher client) and **PR A2** = PR #13 (the home screen + save-on-generate + open→hydrate→Step 6 + inline key). PR B (#14) and PR C (#15) match the spec. PR 0 is the companion [discount/regeneration](./2026-06-07-discount-and-live-regeneration-design.md) spec, shipped as PR #11.
- **Zip layout is flatter than the §2 diagram.** What `src/archive/serialize.ts` actually writes:
  ```
  manifest.json        # launcher reads this for the list
  state.json           # hydratable WizardState; the source + anonymized bundles live INLINE here
  memory-state.json    # { currentVersion, refinementHistory } — the resume log
  versions/NNN/        # docmodel.json + deliverables/*.html + meta.json — one per generation
  sources/             # the original uploaded files, as dropped
  blobs/*.bin          # raw image-primitive bytes (can't live in JSON), referenced from state.json
  ```
  There is **no separate `anonymized/` directory** — the anonymized bundle is part of `state.json`, with its image bytes externalized to `blobs/anon-*.bin` (the source bundle's images go to `blobs/source-*.bin`). There is **no `output/` directory** — deliverables live under `versions/NNN/deliverables/`. There is **no `refinements/refinement-<n>.txt`** — the raw refinement text is preserved in `memory-state.json`'s `refinementHistory[].instruction` (local) alongside the `.slugged` form actually sent; same guarantee (raw text kept local, only slugs sent), one fewer artifact.
- **Add-files re-anonymizes the full bundle; only *detection* is incremental.** §8 step 3 said "only the new primitives are slugged." In code, only **detection** runs over the new primitives — `extendMap(existingMap, merged)` extends the approved map with new candidates while **preserving every existing slug** — and then the **whole bundle is re-anonymized against the extended map** (the `anonBundle` is rebuilt, triage/confirmed/pipeline reset). This is simpler and equally safe: every primitive, old or new, is slugged with the current map.
- **`extendMap` seeds new slugs from the max existing index, not the count.** New slugs continue from the highest numeric index already present for each category prefix (e.g. `CF_ORG_03` even if only `CF_ORG_01` survives a removal), so removing a phrase and adding another of the same type can never reuse a live slug and collapse two real names. (A subtle bug caught in PR C review.)
- **Two transient (non-serialized) navigation fields, not one.** §9 listed `pendingRefinement`; the shipped state (`src/ui/state.ts`) carries both `addFilesMode?` and `pendingRefinement?`, marked transient and excluded from `state.json`. `refinementHistory` is persisted in `memory-state.json` (not `state.json`); `caseId`/`caseCreatedAt` are restored from `manifest.json`, with `caseCreatedAt` preserved across re-saves so the original creation time survives.
- **Routes are REST-shaped, with the id in the path.** §4 sketched `POST /archive` carrying the `caseId` in the body; the shipped routes are `PUT /archive/{id}`, `GET /archive/{id}`, `DELETE /archive/{id}`, and `GET /archives` (the upload is the raw zip bytes with `content-type: application/zip`). The browser client (`src/launcher/transport.ts`) gained `putBinary`/`getBytes`/`del` for exactly these.
- **Launcher hardening went beyond the `..`-guard.** `launcher/archive.go` validates `{id}` against `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$`, caps the upload at 200 MiB (distinguishing a `MaxBytesError` as HTTP 413), saves atomically (temp + rename), refuses a body that isn't a zip-with-`manifest.json`, and — added in review — resolves symlinks and confines every read/write inside the archive directory (`safeArchiveFile`), so a symlinked entry can't escape it. The list endpoint skips symlinked entries.
- **Both Step 5 and Step 6 never wipe a good preview on a blocked/failed (re)generate**, and a save failure surfaces a visible warning rather than silently losing the deliverables (which remain exportable). The inline API-key prompt on an archive-opened case (§6) shipped as specified.

## 1. Motivation & goals

Today CaseForge is single-shot: a rep walks the seven-step wizard once, exports the deliverables, and the in-memory state is gone when the tab closes. There is no way to come back to a case, refine it later, or add a file the customer sent after the fact.

Goals:

- **Persist a complete case** — the original source files, the anonymized files that were sent to the LLM, the generated deliverables, and enough state to *resume*.
- **Reopen & refine** — open a prior case and land in the Refine step with the business case loaded; refining continues the narrative rather than starting cold.
- **Add files later** — bring new artifacts into an existing case, anonymizing only the new ones (reusing the approved map), then regenerate.
- **No new privacy surface** — only anonymized content ever reaches the LLM; archives are local-only and never uploaded.

Non-goals (v1): cloud sync, multi-user sharing, archive encryption.

> **Regeneration recomputes — it does not replay frozen numbers.** Earlier drafts of this spec said "numbers stay engine-locked; refinement is wording-only." That was wrong and has been corrected: **every regeneration re-runs the current sizing + cost calculations** (current `ENGINE_CONFIG`, current rates, current discount, plus any newly added files), then rewrites prose on the fresh figures. This matters most for archives — a reopened case can be old enough that Oracle rates or our formula constants have changed since it was generated, and regenerating must reflect *today's* numbers. The mechanics live in the companion spec [Customer Discount & Always-Current Regeneration](./2026-06-07-discount-and-live-regeneration-design.md), which is a prerequisite PR (PR 0) for this feature.

## 2. What an archive is

A **single portable `.zip` per case**, stored by the launcher under `~/CaseForge/archives/<caseId>.zip`. `caseId` is a slug = `slug(companyName) + "-" + <shortTimestamp>` (e.g. `northwind-mutual-k9f2a1`), validated to `[a-z0-9-]+`.

Division of labor — **all zip building/parsing lives in TypeScript** (JSZip is already a dependency, and the logic is unit-testable under Vitest); the **Go launcher is a dumb blob store** that only peeks at `manifest.json` to build the home-screen list:

```
<caseId>.zip
├── manifest.json       # caseId, companyName, provider, discountPct, status, schemaVersion,
│                       #   createdAt, updatedAt, currentVersion, versions[] index
├── state.json          # the hydratable WizardState (minus the API key, minus raw image bytes)
├── memory-state.json   # currentVersion pointer + refinementHistory[]  ← the "resume" log
├── sources/            # ORIGINAL uploaded files, exactly as dropped (contains PII)
├── anonymized/         # what the LLM saw: slugged text/tables as JSON, redacted images as PNG
├── versions/           # every generated content package — NEVER overwritten on regen
│   ├── 001/
│   │   ├── docmodel.json          # the DocModel (numbers + prose + claims) for this version
│   │   ├── deliverables/*.html    # the 4 rendered docs for this version
│   │   └── meta.json              # createdAt, trigger (initial|refine|add-files), instruction?, discountPct
│   └── 002/ …                     # each regenerate adds a new numbered version
└── refinements/        # refinement-<n>.txt — the raw prompt text the rep typed
```

Image bytes (`Uint8Array`) cannot live in JSON, so image primitives in `state.json` / `anonymized/` reference their zip entry by path; the browser lazily reads the bytes back from the zip on load.

### Versioning — regeneration never deletes the prior content package

Every generation produces a **content package** = the `DocModel` + the four rendered deliverables + a `meta.json` recording what produced it (timestamp, trigger, the refine instruction if any, the `discountPct` in effect). These are written to a new numbered `versions/NNN/` directory; **regeneration appends a new version and never overwrites or deletes earlier ones**. `manifest.json.currentVersion` names the latest; `memory-state.json` keeps the pointer + the refinement log (each `refinementHistory` entry references the `versionId` it produced). On open, the app loads `currentVersion`; the Refine/Export views offer a version picker so the rep can view, compare, or export any prior package. (Versions are cheap — HTML + JSON; if a future case accumulates very many, we can cap or prune oldest-beyond-N, but v1 keeps them all.)

### `manifest.json` (launcher reads this for the list)

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "caseId": "northwind-mutual-k9f2a1",
  "companyName": "Northwind Mutual",
  "provider": "claude",
  "discountPct": 15,                // per-case customer discount (see companion spec)
  "status": "generated",            // "generated" | "refined"
  "createdAt": "2026-06-07T18:20:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-06-07T18:41:00Z",
  "currentVersion": "003",
  "versions": [                     // append-only; never pruned in v1
    { "id": "001", "createdAt": "2026-06-07T18:20:00Z", "trigger": "initial",    "discountPct": 0 },
    { "id": "002", "createdAt": "2026-06-07T18:33:00Z", "trigger": "refine",     "discountPct": 0 },
    { "id": "003", "createdAt": "2026-06-07T18:41:00Z", "trigger": "add-files",  "discountPct": 15 }
  ]
}
```

### `memory-state.json` (the resume log)

```jsonc
{
  "currentVersion": "003",
  "refinementHistory": [
    { "ts": "2026-06-07T18:33:00Z", "instruction": "tighten the exec summary", "slugged": "tighten the exec summary", "versionId": "002" }
  ]
}
```

The current `DocModel` itself lives in `versions/<currentVersion>/docmodel.json` (not duplicated here). `slugged` is the anonymized form actually sent to the LLM (see §7); storing both the raw `instruction` (local) and the `slugged` form keeps the archive faithful while guaranteeing the model only ever saw slugs. Each entry references the `versionId` it produced.

## 3. Why "resume the conversation" becomes a memory-state file

A key finding from tracing the code: **the LLM layer is fully stateless.** Both the initial generate and Step-6 refine build a fresh single-turn request (`messages: [{ role: 'user', content }]`, `src/orchestrate/prose.ts`); there is no transcript object, no message IDs, no server-side conversation handle (`src/provider/types.ts`). So there is no original conversation to "resume" literally.

The good news is that it doesn't matter: **`generateProse` rebuilds its entire context deterministically from the `docModel`** via `buildProseContext`, which carries *only* numbers, topology, and generic engine assumptions — never the company name or any real phrase (the renderer injects the real name locally at render time). So:

- `docModel` is **anonymization-safe** — refine doesn't leak today, and the memory-state file is safe to store and re-send.
- Reloading `docModel` already restores everything the model needs.
- The only missing piece for continuity is the **history of prior refinement instructions** — captured in `refinementHistory[]` and replayed on each refine.

This is functionally indistinguishable from resuming a conversation, and it survives app restarts. It is the only viable design given the stateless provider layer, and it is what the rest of this spec builds on.

## 4. Launcher endpoints (Go)

New routes alongside the existing `/anonymize`, `/deanonymize`, `/health` (same `serve.go` style, the same `..`-traversal guard, `127.0.0.1`-only):

| Method & path | Body / params | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /archive` | `caseId` + raw zip bytes | `{ ok, caseId }` | Writes `~/CaseForge/archives/<caseId>.zip` atomically (temp file + rename). Overwrites on update. |
| `GET /archives` | — | `[{ caseId, companyName, status, updatedAt, refineCount }]` | For each zip, read **only** `manifest.json` to build the row. Unreadable/corrupt zips are skipped, not fatal. |
| `GET /archive/{caseId}` | — | zip bytes | `Cache-Control: no-store`. |
| `DELETE /archive/{caseId}` | — | `{ ok }` | Remove a case from the home screen. |

Hardening (mirrors the existing launcher posture): `caseId` validated to `[a-z0-9-]+` before it touches the filesystem; `MaxBytesReader` on the upload; the archives directory is created on first save under the user's home; archive reads/writes are confined to that directory (no path escape). The browser client (`src/launcher/client.ts`) gains `saveArchive`, `listArchives`, `loadArchive`, `deleteArchive`.

## 5. Lifecycle

- **Temporary archive = the current in-memory `WizardState`.** Nothing is persisted while the rep moves Setup → … → Generate. ("Collect data in a temporary archive that isn't saved" = exactly today's ephemeral state.)
- **On successful Generate (Step 5):** assign a `caseId`, write content package `versions/001/`, build the zip in TS, `POST /archive`. The case now exists on disk with `status: "generated"`, `currentVersion: "001"`.
- **Update (re-POST the same `caseId`)** after each successful **refine** or **add-files**: a **new** `versions/NNN/` is appended (prior versions untouched), `currentVersion` advances, `updatedAt` bumps, `status` becomes `"refined"`. Export does not create a version (it just downloads from the selected one).

## 6. Home screen & opening a case

Today the app always mounts at Step 1. We add a **pre-wizard home screen**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  CaseForge                  │
│  ▸ + New business case      │
│  ─ Recent cases ─────────── │
│  • Northwind Mutual  6/05   │
│  • Acme Re-platform  5/28   │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

- **New business case** → today's wizard from Step 1.
- **Open** (`GET /archives` populates the list; `GET /archive/{id}` loads one) → unzip in the browser, hydrate `WizardState` from `state.json` + lazily-loaded image bytes, and set `step: 6` **directly** in the hydrated state. The wizard renders whatever `state.step` is, so the Refine view shows immediately — viewing the deliverables needs no API key.
- **API key on open / navigation:** the key is session-only (never archived). Note `maxReachableStep` gates *clicking* between steps on **all** prior steps being valid, and `stepValidity[1]` requires `hasApiKey` — so until the key is entered, the stepper rail is locked even though we've landed on Step 6. That's fine for viewing. A refine needs the key, so the refine action, when `!hasApiKey`, shows a small inline key prompt (prefilled provider/company from the archive). Once the key is set, every hydrated step (config, bundle, anonBundle, confirmed, docModel) is valid, so `maxReachableStep` restores full back/forth navigation across the case — no walk back through Setup required.

## 7. Refinement continuity & instruction handling

- **Regeneration recomputes numbers with current settings** (see the companion spec). On refine, `runPipeline` re-runs the deterministic sizing + TCO math from the cached triage using the current `ENGINE_CONFIG` and the current `discountPct`, then rewrites prose — so a reopened old case refreshes to today's rates rather than replaying the archived figures. *Viewing* a reopened case shows the last-generated numbers; *regenerating* supersedes them, with a "rates may have changed — Regenerate to refresh" hint on archive-opened cases.
- `memory-state.json` carries `docModel` + an accumulating `refinementHistory[]`. Each refine appends its instruction; the next regeneration replays the history so the model has continuity.
- **The refinement instruction is slug-anonymized before it reaches the LLM.** Today the instruction text is passed to `generateProse` raw (`src/orchestrate/prose.ts`) — if a rep types a real customer name in the refine box, it leaks. This is a latent gap we close as part of this feature: run the instruction through the launcher `/anonymize` with the current map; the LLM sees slugs, while the **raw** text is saved to `refinements/refinement-<n>.txt` (local only) and to `refinementHistory[].instruction`.

## 8. Adding files during refine

A new **"Add more files"** action in Step 6:

1. Capture the current refine-box text into `refinements/refinement-<n>.txt` and stash it as a new `pendingRefinement` state field so it survives the detour back through the wizard.
2. Reset to **Step 2 (Drop files)** with the existing source files **preselected**, plus the **memory-state file** preselected (so its context is in scope), plus the new refinement `.txt`.
3. The rep adds new files. **Only the new files are ingested + anonymized.** The existing approved `map` is the baseline; detection runs over the **new primitives only**; new candidates extend/merge into the map; only the new primitives are slugged (the existing `anonBundle` primitives are retained). New images go through the same scan → review → redact gate.
4. Flow back through Confirm → Generate. The carried `pendingRefinement` instructions are included in the regeneration and then appended to `refinementHistory`.

This reuses the existing downstream-reset cascade in `Step2DropFiles` (re-dropping already invalidates `anonBundle`/`triage`/`pipeline`); the new wrinkle is *incremental* anonymization keyed off the prior map rather than a from-scratch re-detect.

## 9. State changes (`src/ui/state.ts`)

- `WizardState` gains: `caseId: string | null`, `refinementHistory: RefinementEntry[]`, `pendingRefinement: string | null`. (`config.discountPct` is added by the companion spec and is persisted/rehydrated with the rest of `config`.)
- New entry screen sits *before* the stepper; `initialWizardState()` is unchanged for "New", and a new `hydrateFromArchive(zip): Partial<WizardState>` produces the open-case state.
- `stepValidity` is unchanged in spirit; the image fail-closed gate already added in v0.4.0 continues to apply to any images brought in via add-files.

## 10. Privacy

Archives **contain customer PII** (the original `sources/` and the real-name deliverables in `output/`). They are local-only, never uploaded, and `~/CaseForge/archives/` is outside the repo. Only slugged content is ever sent to the LLM — the anonymized bundle, the slug-anonymized refinement instructions, and the anon-safe `docModel`. The archive directory should be documented in the User Guide as containing sensitive data the rep is responsible for.

## 11. Testing strategy

- **TS (Vitest):** archive (de)serialize round-trip (a `WizardState` → zip → `WizardState` with image bytes intact); `manifest.json` parse; incremental-anon merge (new files extend the map, existing slugs preserved); `hydrateFromArchive` → Step 6 reachable; refinement-instruction slug-anonymization; `refinementHistory` replay shape.
- **Go (httptest):** `POST /archive` writes + round-trips; `GET /archives` lists from manifests and skips corrupt zips; `GET`/`DELETE` by id; `caseId` validation rejects traversal; oversized upload rejected.
- **UI:** home screen lists + "New"; open → land on Step 6; add-files → reset to Step 2 with existing + memory file preselected and only-new-files anonymized.

## 12. Build sequencing (three PRs)

Each PR is independently green and shippable. **PR 0** (the companion [discount + always-current regeneration](./2026-06-07-discount-and-live-regeneration-design.md) spec) lands first — the archive refine/resume flow depends on regenerate-recomputes and persists `discountPct`.

- **PR A — Archive core.** Zip schema + (de)serialize round-trip; Go endpoints + tests; save-on-generate; the home screen (New / Open / list / delete); open → hydrate → Step 6; inline API-key re-entry.
- **PR B — Refine continuity.** `memory-state.json` + `refinementHistory` replay; instruction slug-anonymization; refinement `.txt` capture; update-on-refine.
- **PR C — Add-files incremental.** `pendingRefinement` carry-through; Step 2 preselect; incremental detect/merge/anonymize of new files only; regenerate-with-carried-instructions.

## 13. Open questions / defaults chosen

- **Container = `.zip`**, one per case (portable, single artifact). *(default)*
- **`caseId` = slug(company)+short-timestamp.** *(default)*
- **Archive updated on every successful generate/refine/add-files/export.** *(default)*
- **Instruction anonymization on by default.** *(default — also closes a current latent leak)*
- **No archive encryption in v1** — local files; flagged as PII in the User Guide. *(default; revisit if reps store archives on shared drives)*
